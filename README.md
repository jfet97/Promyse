# Promyse

Promyse it's just a bad imitation of the Promise API that is Promises/A+ compliant.\
You won't find an efficient, well written implementation. Only a well-documented one that may or may not help you understand what's going on under the hood.

I had fun writing it, I hope you'll find my code fun too.

P.S.
I've already implemented two new static methods that currently are only proposals: `Promyse.allSettled` and `Promyse.any`.\
Use them at your own risk.

# how
```sh
npm i -S promyse
```

```js
const { Promyse } = require("promyse");
```
